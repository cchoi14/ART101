		<h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
		<p>Experimenting with loops.</p>
		<div id="challenges">
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>Using loops in JavaScript, we made a "FizzBuzz" function which loops through a list of numbers
				and prints them out, but it replces multiples of 3, 5, and 7 with "Fizz" "Buzz" and "Boom" respectively.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="problems">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>We had some troubles adapting the function we built in class to work with DOM, especially since we had
				to use a function that checked if a string was empty, which didn't work well with the fact that we were
				building one big string.</p>

		<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
		<p>Experimentation with functions in JS.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>We challenged ourselves by implementing functions in JS. We also took the bonus Challenges
		and implemented extra features in our script, like ignoring spaces and styling the output.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>We encountered some problems with understanding what functions are and what they do,
		but after experimenting a little bit it made sense.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Here is the styled JS output below.</p>
		<h3>&emsp;Script Output</h3>
		<div id="script-output">
			<script type="text/javascript" src="js/lab.js"></script>

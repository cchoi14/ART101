			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>
		<p>Debugging our old code.</p>
		<div id="challenges">
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>Using the debugger functionality in JS, we revisited our old labs and fixed bugs.</p>

		<div id="problems">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>All of my labs worked, which meant that there wasn't much for me to debug.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="results">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>I went back and cleaned up a lot of the labs, though. I added a "Back to Home" link to each
				and renamed files and deleted unnecessary ones. I guess it was more of a house cleaning operation
				than a debugging one, but not cleaning up can lead to bugs (I think).</p>

			<h2>Debugging</h2>
			<p>Lab 1 through Lab 8, I added a "Back to Home" link to make navigation easier.<br>
			Lab 1 through Lab 6, I deleted unnecessary image files carried over from the template.<br>
			I also tried to answer JavaScript questions on StackOverflow but pretty much all of the questions
			were way beyond my expertise.</p>
